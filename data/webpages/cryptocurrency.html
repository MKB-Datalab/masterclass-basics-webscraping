Mining can be an energy-intensive process in which computers solve complex puzzles in order to verify the authenticity of transactions on the network. As a reward, the owners of those computers can receive newly created cryptocurrency. Other cryptocurrencies use different methods to create and distribute tokens, and many have a significantly lighter environmental impact.</span></p></div><div class="FTDQoV"><p class="_2GMChG _3-to_p"><span class="_2GMChG _3-to_p">For most people, the easiest way to get cryptocurrency is to buy it, either from an exchange or another user.</span></p></div><div class="FTDQoV"><p class="_2GMChG _3-to_p"><span class="_3Rmqs8 _2GMChG _3-to_p"><span class="_3Rmqs8 _2GMChG _3-to_p">\xc2\xbb Ready to invest?</span></span><a class="_2GMChG eIBHSv _23_Bjp _2zmeFA" href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/crypto-exchanges-platforms" data-currency="Link" target="_self"><span class="_2GMChG _3-to_p"> Here are our picks for best cryptocurrency exchanges.</span></a></p></div><div class="FTDQoV"><h2 class="_2HGwPY _7LUqYM _2GMChG _1VhA5C" data-currency="Text"><span class="_2HGwPY _7LUqYM _2GMChG _3-to_p">How to buy cryptocurrency safely</span></h2></div><div class="FTDQoV"><p class="_2GMChG _3-to_p"><span class="_2GMChG _3-to_p">Buying cryptocurrencies securely involves four basic steps:</span></p></div><div class="FTDQoV"><h3 class="_23_GlS _1jyA_Q _2McN3Z _2GMChG _1VhA5C" data-currency="Text"><span class="_23_GlS _1jyA_Q _2McN3Z _2GMChG _3-to_p">1.

Centralized exchanges act as a third party overseeing transactions to give customers confidence that they are getting what they pay for. These exchanges typically sell crypto at market rates, and they make money on fees for various aspects of their services.</span></p></div><div class="FTDQoV"><p class="_2GMChG _3-to_p"><span class="_2GMChG _3-to_p">If you&#x27;re more accustomed to traditional brokerage accounts, there are a few online brokers that offer access to cryptocurrencies as well as stocks. Of the online brokers reviewed by NerdWallet, these include Robinhood, Webull, SoFi Active Investing and TradeStation. If you&#x27;re looking for an exchange that operates solely within the cryptocurrency world, look for pure-play crypto exchanges. These platforms, such as Coinbase, Gemini and Kraken, won&#x27;t give you access to core assets like stocks and bonds, but they typically have a much better selection of cryptocurrencies, and more</span><a class="_2GMChG eIBHSv _23_Bjp _2zmeFA" href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/best-crypto-staking-platforms" data-currency="Link" target="_self"><span class="_2GMChG _3-to_p"> on-platform crypto storage options</span></a><span class="_2GMChG _3-to_p">.</span></p></div><div class="FTDQoV"><p class="_2GMChG _3-to_p"><span class="_2GMChG _3-to_p">Though centralized exchanges are relatively easy to use, they also can be an attractive target for hackers given the volume of crypto that flows through them.</span></p></div><div class="FTDQoV"><p class="_2GMChG _3-to_p"><span class="_2GMChG _3-to_p">For more advanced users, there are decentralized exchanges whose fees can be lower than those charged by centralized platforms. Those can be more difficult to use and demand more technical know-how, but they may also offer some security benefits because there is no single target for a cyberattack.

The challenge in a blockchain network is in making sure that all participants can agree on the correct copy of the historical ledger. Without a recognized way to validate transactions, it would be difficult for people to trust that their holdings are secure. There are several ways of reaching &quot;consensus&quot; on a blockchain network, but the two that are most widely used are known as &quot;proof of work&quot; and &quot;proof of stake.\xe2\x80\x9d</p></p></div></div></div><div class="OE0NEO fyWLSM" style="display:none"><div class="OE0NEO fyWLSM">What does proof of work mean?</div><div class="OE0NEO fyWLSM"><div class="OE0NEO fyWLSM _2gpzlo"><p><p class="_2GMChG _3-to_p">Proof of work is one way of incentivizing users to help maintain an accurate historical record of who owns what on a blockchain network. Bitcoin uses proof of work, which makes this method an important part of the crypto conversation. Blockchains rely on users to collate and submit blocks of recent transactions for inclusion in the ledger, and Bitcoin&#x27;s protocol rewards them for doing so successfully. This process is known as mining.</p></p><p><p class="_2GMChG _3-to_p">There is stiff competition for these rewards, so many users try to submit blocks, but only one can be selected for each new block of transactions. To decide who gets the reward, Bitcoin requires users to solve a difficult puzzle, which uses a huge amount of energy and computing power. The completion of this puzzle is the &quot;work&quot; in proof of work.</p></p><p><p class="_2GMChG _3-to_p">For lucky miners, the Bitcoin rewards are more than enough to offset the costs involved. But the huge upfront cost is also a way to discourage dishonest players. If you win the right to create a block, it might not be worth the risk of tampering with the records and having your submission thrown out \xe2\x80\x94 forfeiting the reward. In this instance, spending the money on energy costs in an attempt to tamper with the historical record would have resulted in significant loss.</p></p><p><p class="_2GMChG _3-to_p">Ultimately, the goal of proof of work is to make it more rewarding to play by the rules than to try to break them.</p></p><p><strong><p class="_2GMChG _3-to_p">\xc2\xbb Learn more:</p></strong><p class="_2GMChG _3-to_p"> </p><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/what-is-bitcoin" target="_self"><p class="_2GMChG _3-to_p">How does Bitcoin work?</p></a></p></div></div></div><div class="OE0NEO fyWLSM" style="display:none"><div class="OE0NEO fyWLSM">What is proof of stake?</div><div class="OE0NEO fyWLSM"><div class="OE0NEO fyWLSM _2gpzlo"><p><p class="_2GMChG _3-to_p">Proof of stake is another way of achieving consensus about the accuracy of the historical record of transactions on a blockchain. It eschews mining in favor of a process known as staking, in which people put some of their own cryptocurrency holdings at stake to vouch for the accuracy of their work in validating new transactions. Some of the cryptocurrencies that use proof of stake include Cardano, Solana and Ethereum (which is in the process of converting from proof of work).</p></p><p><p class="_2GMChG _3-to_p">Proof of stake systems have some similarities to proof of work protocols, in that they rely on users to collect and submit new transactions. But they have a different way of incentivizing honest behavior among those who participate in that process. Essentially, people who propose new blocks of information to be added to the record must put some cryptocurrency at stake. In many cases, your chances of landing a new block (and the associated rewards) go up as you put more at stake. People who submit inaccurate data can lose some of the money they&#x27;ve put at risk.</p></p></div></div></div><div class="OE0NEO fyWLSM" style="display:none"><div class="OE0NEO fyWLSM">How do you mine cryptocurrency?</div><div class="OE0NEO fyWLSM"><div class="OE0NEO fyWLSM _2gpzlo"><p><p class="_2GMChG _3-to_p">Mining cryptocurrency is generally only possible for a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin. And before you get too far, it is worth noting that the barriers to entry can be high and the probability of success relatively low without major investment.</p></p><p><p class="_2GMChG _3-to_p">While early Bitcoin users were able to mine the cryptocurrency using regular computers, the task has gotten more difficult as the network has grown. Now, most miners use special computers whose sole job is to run the complex calculations involved in mining all day every day. And even one of these computers isn&#x27;t going to guarantee you success. Many miners use entire warehouses full of mining equipment in their quest to collect rewards.</p></p><p><p class="_2GMChG _3-to_p">If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have the resources to compete with the heavy hitters, one option is joining a mining pool, where users share rewards.

uses a global variable `dataLayer` to manage variables and events.\n\n  // To expose a variable to GTM for use in a tag, do this:\n  //    dataLayer.push({ myVarName: \'myVarValue\' });\n  //\n  // When exposing a variable:\n  // * Explicitly call it out & expose it in isolation (ie not inside an object).\n  // * There should be **no js** required in GTM to access / extract variables.\n  // * Pick up new var by creating an associated DataLayer Variable in the GTM admin panel.\n\n  // To dispatch an event to GTM, push the event name and any pertinent values:\n  //    dataLayer.push({\n  //      event: \'product_outbound_click\',\n  //      productName: \'chase_cool_card\',\n  //    });\n  //\n  // About events:\n  // * Tags in GTM can be set up to fire when a certain event is pushed into the dataLayer.\n  // * Set up new event by creating an associated Trigger in the GTM admin panel.\n\n  // More on the dataLayer\n  // * `dataLayer` is enhanced by GTM and should be declared before GTM is instantiated, not after.\n  // * We always use `push` to add values. This avoids accidentally replacing a previously defined dataLayer.\n\n  dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\n  dataLayer.push({\n    // taxonomy values are templated because we can get them server side\n    gtmPageVertical: \'Investing\',\n    gtmQuantcastLabel: \'Vertical.Investing\',\n    gtmPageTopic: \'Investments\',\n    gtmPageType: \'undefined\',\n    gtmContentType: \'article\',\n    gtmContentClusters: \'\',\n    isNWMobileApp: \'false\',\n    isLoggedIn: \'false\',\n    gtmAttrVertical: \'Investing\',\n    gtmAttrTopic: \'Investing Strategy\',\n    gtmPrimaryCluster: \'Alt Investments\'\n\n    // Below values have to wait for nwa to load, and are pushed separately:\n    // gtmCookieId - for Sizmek & Facebook\n    // gtmPageViewId - for Sizmek\n  });\n</script>\n<!-- End dataLayer for Google Tag Manager -->\n\n<!-- Google Tag Manager -->\n<script>\n  // GTM code\n  (function(){\n    var init = function (w,d,s,l,i) {\n      w[l]=w[l]||[];w[l].push({\n      \'gtm.start\': new Date().getTime(),event:\'gtm.js\'});var f=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],\n      j=d.createElement(s),dl=l!=\'dataLayer\'?\'&l=\'+l:\'\';j.async=true;j.src=\n      \'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id=\'+i+dl;f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);\n    }.bind(null, window,document,\'script\',\'dataLayer\',\'GTM-NVWSKF5\');\n\n    if (document.readyState === \'interactive\' || document.readyState === \'complete\') {\n      init()\n    } else {\n      document.addEventListener(\'DOMContentLoaded\', init)\n    }\n  })();\n</script>\n<!-- End Google Tag Manager -->\n\n<script>!function(e){var t={};function r(n){if(t[n])return t[n].exports;var o=t[n]={i:n,l:!1,exports:{}};return e[n].call(o.exports,o,o.exports,r),o.l=!0,o.exports}r.m=e,r.c=t,r.d=function(e,t,n){r.o(e,t)||Object.defineProperty(e,t,{enumerable:!0,get:n})},r.r=function(e){"undefined"!=typeof Symbol&&Symbol.toStringTag&&Object.defineProperty(e,Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"}),Object.defineProperty(e,"__esModule",{value:!0})},r.t=function(e,t){if(1&t&&(e=r(e)),8&t)return e;if(4&t&&"object"==typeof e&&e&&e.__esModule)return e;var n=Object.create(null);if(r.r(n),Object.defineProperty(n,"default",{enumerable:!0,value:e}),2&t&&"string"!=typeof e)for(var o in e)r.d(n,o,function(t){return e[t]}.bind(null,o));return n},r.n=function(e){var t=e&&e.__esModule?function(){return e.default}:function(){return e};return r.d(t,"a",t),t},r.o=function(e,t){return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e,t)},r.p="",r(r.s=0)}([function(e,t){!function e(){const{nwa:t}=window;return t&&t.getUserProp("cookieId")&&t.getGlobalProp("pageViewId")?(window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[],window.dataLayer.push({gtmPageViewId:t.getGlobalProp("pageViewId"),gtmCookieId:t.getUserProp("cookieId"),event:"nwa_values_ready"})):setTimeout(e,300)}()}]);</script>\n<script>\n  (function () {\n    window.__KOUNT_SESSION_ID__ = \'51d8b86775c44be1bdf183ef70f11b23\';\n    \n    document.addEventListener(\'DOMContentLoaded\', function() {\n      var script = document.createElement(\'script\');\n      script.src = \'https://ssl.kaptcha.com/collect/sdk?m=171456&s=51d8b86775c44be1bdf183ef70f11b23\';\n      script.defer = true;\n      script.async = true;\n      script.onload = function () {\n        setTimeout(function () {\n          if (typeof ka !== \'undefined\') {\n            var client = new ka.ClientSDK();\n            client.collectData();\n          }\n        }, 0);\n      };\n      document.body.appendChild(script);\n    });    \n  })();\n</script><script type="text/javascript">(function(){window[\'__CF$cv$params\']={r:\'6f40a0dadf6797ac\',m:\'1U_E0bnjMEadSCnyvtUXM2Rv.JQP42j1xIWY2YpBYZc-1648641034-0-ATvv4/yOZ9A2I08wLCjmKXKtgfp5jNg7V5Z2P6fjyTQNjiYWYxae3es8NAG2ghFKDag9xcrCWrAzqWJrzawkxvTB7FCIrl6TqG7bKvpuPsVZfidNbvkA6r3g3MAk5FFb7x3rRPlkGv3ypgl0d9v5K2oYJIF8zFMstmE9KTkBGVAK\',s:[0x0b3f7c1d44,0x3afe5497e8],}})();</script></body></html>'
